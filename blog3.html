        <h3>Channapatna Toys </h3>
        <h4>
            Not many toys can boast of having a 300-year old history that began because of a king;
            except for the wooden toys made in Channapatna.
            It is said King Tipu Sultan who ruled from 1750 to 1799 received a lacquered Persian toy which
            excited him enough to send for artisans from there to train some of his people. The Indian artisans
            settled in Channapatna and have continued practicing the same craft through generations.
            Channapatna toys are made from soft ivory wood or hale mara and then coated with lacquer which is made from vegetable dyes.
            These dyes are used in the colouring process to ensure that the toys and dolls are non-toxic and safe for use by children.
            The real charm of Channapatna is that the craft is not practiced in large-scale industries and factories,
            but within the confines of small homes and workshops which extend to villages nearby.
